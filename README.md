# Financial-Analysis
This project aimed to develop an interactive Power BI financial dashboard to analyze sales, orders, profit margins, and discounts across multiple regions.Using DAX measures and data modeling, the dashboard provided real-time insights to aid strategic decision-making.

# Project Objective:
Track and compare current vs. prior-year sales performance across different countries.
Identify key financial indicators such as profit margins, order trends, and discount variations for better financial planning.
Automate reporting to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy in financial analysis.

# Project Steps:
Data Extraction & Cleaning: Imported sales data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Data Modeling: Established relationships between tables to support efficient analysis.
DAX Measures Development: Created custom calculations for sales growth, profit margin, and discount distribution.
Dashboard Design: Built interactive Power BI visuals for tracking financial KPIs.
Testing & Optimization: Validated data accuracy and improved dashboard performance.

# Key DAX Measures Used:
Sales Growth (%) = (Current Year Sales - Previous Year Sales) / Previous Year Sales
Profit Margin (%) = Profit / Sales
Total Discount (%) = Sum of Discount Amount / Total Sales
Orders Count by Country = COUNTROWS(Orders Table)

# Insights & Conclusions:
923M+ in sales analyzed, with a 249% increase from the previous year.
Profit margins varied across regions, with Germany and France showing the highest profitability.
Channel partners had the highest profit margins (73%), while enterprises showed negative profitability (-3%).
Automating financial reporting with DAX reduced manual analysis time by 40%, improving efficiency.
